Greetings, fellow investigators. My name is Anthony Miller.

I used to live in Arizona with my mom. On 2011 we moved to Michigan after a work offer popped up.  
I've been living on Brighton since. It's a pretty quiet and beautiful town to live in, but there's not much to do.

That's when I decided to become my very own...  Ghost Hunter? Ghostbuster? I'm,still working on a name :P

I realized my destiny was chasing the multiple mysteries around this town and try and solve as much as I can.
I decided to become the "Mystery Solver" I was very successful and popular too, I even got in the news a few times back!

(You could say I became some sort of "Hero" in my town, saving the innocent citizens from the cold, cruel hands of the supernatural.)

After countless mysteries solved, I finally raised enough money to set up my very own page regarding my passion job! Welcome to BrightonGhosts.com, 
where I study and analyze how all things supernatural work.
You can help out by donating to my blog here for future mystery hunts and other ghost-related projects.
